# Shifting Rhetoric: The Rise of Pro-Nationalist Discourse in European Parliamentary Speeches (2009-2019)

This project analyzes the shifting political rhetoric towards pro-nationalist discourse in European parliamentary speeches across seven countries from 2009 to 2019 using sentiment analysis.

## Abstract

European countries have been dealing with various crises that have contributed to the rise of right-wing political parties and a shift in political rhetoric away from progressive-liberal policies. This study uses the ParlEE dataset to examine parliamentary speeches, applying sentiment analysis to highlight differences and commonalities in pro-nationalist discourse related to immigration, cultural hegemony, and ethnic threat. The goal is to elucidate rhetorical strategies and their political motivations in the legislative context.

## Dataset
